<br>
To test the payment of a shopping cart, you need a test environment. PayPal offers a sanbox for developers.
<br>
To integrate this online payment system into a site, you must implement the PayPal JavaScript SDK (a PayPal JavaScript library) to accept (receive) online payments by clicking on the PayPal buttons.
<br>
To start, you must create a PayPal account intended for developers, then create a Business account and another Personal to be able to carry out the tests. Create a PayPal application with the "Create App" service. All these steps are automatic but you can customize if you wish.
<br>
Import the JavaScript SDK into an HTML page by specifying the merchant's Client ID.
<br>User can click "pay" from PayPal and a modal box opens: they can login, approve, cancel or pay.
